A robot that uses fiducial markers (ArUco) to obtain the relative position to the marker and adjusts its position using PID control to follow the moving marker.

## Installation
Get the Raspberry Pi Ubuntu Mate Installation for your Rpi:
https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/


Install git:

``` $ sudo apt-get install git ```

Install OpenCV with Python in the Rpi in order to make use of the ArUco library:

``` $ sudo apt-get install python-opencv ```

Clone the repository anywhere you want:

``` $ git clone https://github.com/hpoleselo/SSFR.git ```

## Usage

If you want to check how we retrieve the model for the control, check the folder ``` PlantModel ``` with MATLAB.

## Lessons Learned

Check the file [linque] to the next time we decide building a robot from scratch...
